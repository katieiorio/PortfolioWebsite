            <p class="projectWrittenContent">Unwind & Grind is a fictional coffee shop brand for which I designed a
                variety of branding elements.
            </p>
            <p class="projectWrittenContent">I began this project by nailing down a solid aesthetic and brand
                appearance. I chose soft blues to align with the "unwind" theme of the coffee shop. I used Adobe
                Illustrator to create two simple, yet effective brand logos that are easily recognizable, even when
                sized down. Creating mockups which implemented the branding brought the coffee shop to life.
            </p>
            <p class="projectWrittenContent">I then designed a mobile app for the business. Online ordering has a
                substantial market, especially in the coffee industry. I drew inspiration from coffee applications that
                I use frequently (maybe even a little too frequently) to help me craft a seamless user experience and
                user interface. I created the layouts using Figma, then after exporting the artboards, used Adobe
                Photoshop to create smartphone mockups.
            </p>
            <p class="projectWrittenContent">This project combined my love for coffee with my design skills and I am
                excited to continue improving this project. I plan to design a website for the brand and eventually move
                on to develop both the app and website.

            </div>
            <p class="projectWrittenContent">The brand board embodies the essence of Unwind & Grind. The coffee shop
                band board is designed with a palette inspired by the quality and simplicity of the coffee. The fonts
                are carefully selected to blend boldness with approachability, ensuring clear communication of the
                offerings. Three logos were designed to serve various purposes for the brand: packaging, employee
                merchandise, and digital usage. Although this brand is fictional, I know I would be inclined to try
                Unwind & Grind for my next cup of coffee.

            <p class="projectWrittenContent">The Unwind & Grind mobile app customer experience started as wireframes
                sketched on print out smartphone drawings. I drew inspiration from one of my local coffee shops, Rook
                who uses an app for mobile orders. When the wireframes were complete, I utilized Figma to build
                prototypes. This is where the vision begins to come to life. When complete, I exported the artboards and
                leveraged free iPhone mockups to get the true look and feel of the mobile app on a real phone.

            <p class="projectWrittenContent">While interning at Tia Cibani Kids LLC, I was able to assist with the
                Fall/Winter 2021 campaign photoshoot. This included catering to the models and organizing the clothing
                for the shoot. After the shoot was complete, I created a cover for the look book, which showcased the
                best shots from the photoshoot. I incorporated Tia’s established brand of bright pops of color and
                playful typefaces. This was a fun project because I was able to see the process from start to finish.
                This design was created using Adobe Photoshop and later used for the print and digital versions of the
                look book.

            <p class="projectWrittenContent">During my time working with children’s clothing designer Tia Cibani, she
                asked me to design branded labels and information cards. The print material would be used for Tia’s
                Craft Kits, small packages that carried unused design materials that would be included in every product
                order. This project was meant to reuse fashion design materials, while encouraging kids to create their
                own toys, jewelry, or accessories. I took elements from Tia’s current brand, such as her font and yellow
                dot pattern for the design. I used Adobe Illustrator to create these designs, then printed them myself
                in-house at the Tia Cibani studio office.
